A detailed article explaining the role of operating systems in cloud computing — covering virtualization, memory management, scalability, and future trends.

Overview

This repository contains a self-learning article exploring how Operating Systems (OS) play a fundamental role in Cloud Computing.
It discusses concepts like virtualization, resource management, security, automation, and how operating systems evolve to meet the needs of modern cloud platforms.

Article Summary

In today’s digital world, cloud computing has become the backbone of online services. From video streaming to enterprise applications, the cloud enables flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.

At the heart of this infrastructure are Operating Systems, which manage and allocate resources, ensure security, and handle automation across distributed environments. This article explains how OSs — particularly Linux and Windows Server — support virtualization, process management, and scalable cloud architectures.

The piece also explores containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) and future OS trends such as AI-based optimization and energy-efficient computing.
